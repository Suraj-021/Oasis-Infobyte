               <h2>Biography</h2>
               <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam served as president of the Republic of India from 2002 to 2007. As president, Kalam promoted the advancement of the national nuclear weapons program. Kalam also devised a 20-year action plan to achieve economic growth through technological development in India.</p>
               <p>From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister</p>
               <p>His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.</p>
               <p>In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. </p>
               <p> The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.</p>
               <p>On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.</p>
